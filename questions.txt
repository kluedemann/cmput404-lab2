1. When creating the socket, we specify the second argument as socket.SOCK_STREAM.
2. Both use the same socket type. Client sockets create connections using connect(). 
Server sockets use bind(), listen(), and accept() to bind to a port, listen for connections, and 
accept incoming connections from clients.
3. We use the following line to reuse a bind port:
    setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
This will set the option to reuse address to the value 1.
4. We get the client IP address and port number.
5. recv() returns an empty bytestring (b'') 
after the client has closed the connection and the server has read all of the data.
